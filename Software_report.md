Since we are a pure hardware project, the only software involve in our project is LTspice, which is analog electronic circuit simulator produced by Analog Device and it can be downloaded from [LTspice download](https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/design-tools-and-calculators/ltspice-simulator.html).

For beginner, the tutorial can be found [tutorial link](https://www.analog.com/en/education/education-library/videos/video-series/ltspice-getting-started-tutorial.html).

There are five circuit files to simulate in LTSpice for this project:

1.Active Antenna
2.Isolation Amplifier
3.Tracking Filter
4.Triode Mixer
5.Combined System (Antenna, Isolation Amplifier, Tracking Filter, and Triode Mixer)
